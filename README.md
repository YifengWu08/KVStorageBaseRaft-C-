# In today's large-scale distributed systems, a dependable and highly accessible distributed data storage system is required.

# When dealing with enormous amounts of data and high levels of concurrency, traditional centralized databases may encounter challenges such as single points of failure and performance # bottlenecks. To solve these difficulties, this project aims to create a distributed key-value storage database using the Raft consensus algorithm to assure data consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.
